Create AI model and train it to recognize different math symbols to be able to succesfully convert image to text.
    Probably will just train my own model with my own datasets (could use sets already out in the web) just for experience in this area
    Have to make it so model trains off each individual math symbol? Or just more generic ones that can show in different 
    forms (like fractions and summations)?

create interactive executable that will run screenshot based of a short-cut that the user can set.

shows history of all screenshots done with program? Could implement SQlite for this 
    Do i want the history to be the screenshot itself, or the text once its implemented, or both?

Allow user to preview and edit the text version of equation if equation isn't exactly what they wanted? Before they actually implement 
the paste feature for their needs?

Will all the conversions be the same for all applications? Will I need to make it so I have different text conversions based on application
or website the user is going to use the image of their equation for (like Symbolab, Word Doc, Powerpoint, etc)

Should I make my own website for the application? 
    Could be good for some experience in javascript

Considering porting the project for android and potentially apple IOS (depends if i want to pay the Developer lisence)
    Can compile it for mac as well (I think they can run .exe now though have to check)

Figure out how to, after recognizing the equations and each symbol, how to copy it to either clipboard or application itself 
    Make it so it goes one symbol at a time, or all at once?
    Store a db file that contains all the different math symbols? Maybe Unicode?

For Android and IOS, could use kivy as it supports Android, iOS, Windows, and Linux

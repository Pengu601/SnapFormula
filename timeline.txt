Started SnapFormula Project. Idea is to be able to take a screenshot of an equation, and with that screenshot, be able to convert it into text that
can then be pasted into any application, website, or document as needed, with no hassle.

As of today, I have successfully got the screenshot portion working, successfully being able to select a certain area of my screen and storing the 
selected area in the clipboard (could potentially store as a file, depending on how path I decide to go for the project)

Spent a while brainstorming ideas with the program and what I want it to do, and what can be possible and the extent I can scale it to.
